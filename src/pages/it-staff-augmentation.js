          ans : 'IT staff augmentation is a type of outsourcing where a business hires outside IT specialists to support its internal IT employees. IT staff augmentation is a form of outsourcing where a company outsources IT resources from external service providers to supplement their existing IT team. This can include hiring specialized expertise or extra personnel to help complete projects or tasks quickly. By using this type of service, organizations can save time, money, and resources while still having access to the technical know-how they need. '

        {
          que : 'What is the difference between staff augmentation and outsourcing?',
          ans : 'The main difference between staff augmentation and outsourcing is the scope of the services that are provided. When a business outsources certain functions or services, it essentially transfers complete control and ownership to an outside party. Outsourcing typically involves one-time projects that can be completed within a set timeline and budget. Staff augmentation, on the other hand, involves hiring a specialized team of professionals to help with specific tasks'
